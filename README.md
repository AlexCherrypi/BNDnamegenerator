You might remember the old [nsanamegenerator.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20160318190656/http://www.nsanamegenerator.com/). 
In homage to that page I firstly created [alexcherrypi.github.io/nsanamegenerator/](https://alexcherrypi.github.io/nsanamegenerator/). 

But then I really wanted to create one in the mothertongue of my girlfried, because she sometimes just doesn't get the joke.

By using the underlying data of [https://github.com/hdaSprachtechnologie/odenet/](https://github.com/hdaSprachtechnologie/odenet) I created this random word generator.

[alexcherrypi.github.io/BNDnamegenerator/](https://alexcherrypi.github.io/BNDnamegenerator/) currently only behaves like the OG version of [alexcherrypi.github.io/nsanamegenerator/og/](https://alexcherrypi.github.io/nsanamegenerator/og/) that combines two nouns, in all caps and witout any space to seperate the words.

This is just a little side project of mine, so don't expect regular updates and a lot of ongoing development.

But if you want to suggest any features or ideas, submit them by creating an issue. I don't have any templates set up yet (and maybe never will), but don't be scared by thaat. Just write your idea down and submit the issue. :-)
